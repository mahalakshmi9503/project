                    Mayiladuthurai (formerly known as Mayavaram or Mayuram) is
                    a Special grade Municipality and district headquarter of
                    Mayiladuthurai district in Tamil Nadu, India. The town is located
                    at a distance of 256 km (159 mi) from the state capital, Chennai.</p>

                <p>Mayiladuthurai was ruled by Medieval Cholas and subsequently ruled by
                    various dynasties, including the Vijayanagar Empire, Thanjavur Nayaks,
                    Thanjavur Marathas and the British Empire. Mayiladuthurai was a part
                    of the erstwhile Tanjore district until India's independence in 1947
                    and Thanjavur district until 1991 and subsequently a part of the
                    newly formed Nagapattinam district. The town is known for
                    agriculture and weaving. As Mayiladuthurai District is situated in
                    East Coast, fishing plays a vital role on generating its revenue.
                    In 2023, the district was declared as a protected agricultural zone.
                    [1]</p>

                <p>Mayiladuthurai is administered by a town panchayat established in 1866.
                    As of 2008, the Panchayat covered an area of 11.27 km2 (4.35 sq mi).
                    Mayiladuthurai comes under the Mayiladuthurai assembly constituency
                    which elects a member to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly once
                    every five years and it is a part of the Mayiladuthurai constituency
                    which elects its Member of Parliament (MP) once in five years.
                    It is well connected by road and rail transport. Mayiladuthurai
                    serves as an important junction in main line connecting Chennai
                    with Trichy. Roadways and Railways are the major mode of
                    transportation to the town. The nearest airport, Pondicherry
                    Airport, is located 116 km (72 mi) from the town.</p>

                <p>Mayiladuthurai was carved out of Nagapattinam district and inaugurated
                    as the 38th district of Tamil Nadu on December 28, 2020.[2]</p>

                 Mayuranathaswami, literally husband of Mayuram, is the presiding deity of the temple. Legend says that Parvati fell out of favour with Lord Shiva and because of his ensuing anger, Shiva cursed Parvati to be born as a peahen.

                </p>
                <p>Mayura, an incarnation of Parvati, worshipped and appeased Lord Shiva at Mayiladuthurai at the site of the temple. The idol in the temple is depicted as worshipping the lingam, telling the story of Mayiladuthurai for all to see. The oldest inscriptions on the temple walls date back to the time of the Kulothunga Chola.

            <p>Dakshinamoorthy Temple in Mayiladuthurai depicts Lord Shiva as a guru, a teacher, 
                somebody who endows knowledge. This form of Shiva as Dakshinamoorthy is especially popular in Tamil Nadu and other Southern parts of the country. Dakshinamoorthy literally translates as ‘one who is facing south’.

                /</p>
                <p>In every Dakshinamoorthy temple, the idol is positioned southwards as against idols that are usually positioned eastwards. The Dakshinamoorthy idol is usually depicted as having four arms, placed under a banyan tree. His right leg lies on a mythical apasmara (a demon who is the embodiment of ignorance) and his left leg lies folded on his lap.
